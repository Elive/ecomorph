Ecomorph is a compositing manager for e17. It consists of the ecomorph
module for e17 and ecomp. ecomp is based on compiz 0.6.

0. install the latest e from svn (yes, important!)
1. install ecomp, from http://github.com/jeffdameth/ecomp/tree/master
2. install ecomorph module.. from there where this REAME file comes from 
3. load ecomorph module
4. in main menu -> settings choose ecomorph
5. click 'start ecomp'
5. activate ecomorph mode
6. click apply

7. if everything works well you can log out 
   and start ecomorph.sh + ecomorph-mode
   via "ecomorph - e17 session"

8. configure bindings for actions with e's mouse-, key- and edge-bindings 
   dialogs.
